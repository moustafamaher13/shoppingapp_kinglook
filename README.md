# shoppingapp_kinglook

the app is simply an interface for the home page for an e-Commerce app named Kinglook

i have attached the assest used, i insisted to use IMAGE.Asset instead of IMAGE.Network to test experience creating the assests in the project file

I have created 4 dart files:
1) Main file contains the main functions that launches the app
2) product page that contains the responsive desgin and used pageView and GridView Widget and for the offers i went to listview
3) product cards and this was responsible for adjusting the card specs and view of the product
4) hotoffers and i used it to work horozontial as requested

Thank you and looking forward to hearing your positive feedback
